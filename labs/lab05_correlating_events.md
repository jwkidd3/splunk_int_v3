> **Note**: This lab should be completed in a non-production environment.

## Lab Description

This lab covers:
- Using the transaction command to correlate related events
- Grouping events by session identifiers
- Calculating transaction duration
- Filtering transactions by duration
- Using startswith and endswith parameters
- Analyzing user sessions and workflows

## Scenario

You are a Splunk administrator for Buttercup Games, an e-commerce company. The web development team needs to analyze user sessions to understand customer behavior, identify long-running transactions, and track the complete purchase workflow from browsing to checkout.

---

## Task 1: Creating Basic Transactions by Session ID

### Scenario

The e-commerce team wants to group all web events that belong to the same user session to understand customer behavior.

### Step 1.1: View Individual Events

First, examine individual web events:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| table _time JSESSIONID clientip action productId
| sort _time
```

**Expected Results**: Individual events showing timestamp, session ID, client IP, action, and product ID

### Step 1.2: Create Transactions by Session ID

Use the transaction command to group events by JSESSIONID:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| table JSESSIONID duration eventcount
```

**Expected Results**: Each row represents a complete session, showing the session ID, duration in seconds, and number of events in the session

### Step 1.3: Display Actions Within Each Transaction

Show the sequence of actions within each session:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| table _time JSESSIONID clientip action duration eventcount
| sort -duration
```

**Expected Results**: Sessions sorted by duration, showing all fields for analysis

**Save this search as**: `L5S1`

> **Note**: The transaction command:
> - Groups events that share common field values
> - Automatically calculates duration (time between first and last event)
> - Adds eventcount (number of events in the transaction)
> - Combines multiple events into a single result

---

## Task 2: Calculating and Analyzing Transaction Duration

### Scenario

The operations team wants to identify sessions that take longer than expected, as they may indicate performance issues or complex customer journeys.

### Step 2.1: Calculate Duration in Minutes

Convert the duration field from seconds to minutes:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| table JSESSIONID clientip durationMinutes eventcount
| sort -durationMinutes
```

**Expected Results**: Sessions with duration displayed in minutes, rounded to 1 decimal place

### Step 2.2: Add Duration Statistics

Calculate statistics about session durations:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| stats count as Sessions,
        avg(durationMinutes) as "Avg Duration (min)",
        max(durationMinutes) as "Max Duration (min)",
        min(durationMinutes) as "Min Duration (min)"
```

**Expected Results**: Summary statistics showing the distribution of session durations

### Step 2.3: Categorize Sessions by Duration

Classify sessions into duration categories:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| eval durationCategory = case(
    durationMinutes < 1, "Quick (< 1 min)",
    durationMinutes >= 1 AND durationMinutes < 5, "Normal (1-5 min)",
    durationMinutes >= 5 AND durationMinutes < 10, "Long (5-10 min)",
    durationMinutes >= 10, "Very Long (> 10 min)"
)
| stats count by durationCategory
| sort -count
```

**Expected Results**: Count of sessions in each duration category

**Save this search as**: `L5S2`

> **Tip**: Understanding session duration helps identify:
> - Performance bottlenecks
> - User engagement patterns
> - Abandoned shopping carts
> - Complex purchase workflows

---

## Task 3: Filtering Transactions by Duration

### Scenario

The development team wants to focus on sessions longer than 1 minute to investigate potential performance issues.

### Step 3.1: Filter Long-Running Sessions

Filter transactions to show only those longer than 1 minute:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| where durationMinutes > 1
| table _time JSESSIONID clientip durationMinutes eventcount action
| sort -durationMinutes
```

**Expected Results**: Only sessions longer than 1 minute are displayed

### Step 3.2: Analyze Actions in Long Sessions

Examine what actions occur in long-running sessions:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| where durationMinutes > 1
| stats count by action
| sort -count
```

**Expected Results**: Breakdown of actions that occur in sessions longer than 1 minute

### Step 3.3: Identify High-Event Sessions

Find sessions with many events:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| where eventcount > 10
| table JSESSIONID clientip durationMinutes eventcount
| sort -eventcount
```

**Expected Results**: Sessions with more than 10 events, indicating active user engagement

**Save this search as**: `L5S3`

> **Note**: Filtering transactions helps you:
> - Focus on specific session types
> - Identify outliers and anomalies
> - Investigate performance issues
> - Understand engaged vs. quick visitors

---

## Task 4: Using Startswith and Endswith Parameters

### Scenario

The sales team wants to track complete purchase workflows - from when a customer adds an item to their cart until they complete the purchase.

### Step 4.1: Define Purchase Workflow Transactions

Create transactions that start with "addtocart" and end with "purchase":

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction clientip startswith="action=addtocart" endswith="action=purchase"
| table _time clientip duration eventcount
```

**Expected Results**: Only transactions that begin with adding to cart and end with a purchase

### Step 4.2: Analyze Complete Purchase Workflows

Examine the details of complete purchase workflows:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction clientip startswith="action=addtocart" endswith="action=purchase"
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| table clientip durationMinutes eventcount productId
| sort -durationMinutes
```

**Expected Results**: Complete purchase workflows with duration and event count

### Step 4.3: Calculate Purchase Conversion Metrics

Calculate statistics for purchase workflows:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction clientip startswith="action=addtocart" endswith="action=purchase"
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| stats count as "Completed Purchases",
        avg(durationMinutes) as "Avg Time to Purchase (min)",
        avg(eventcount) as "Avg Events in Purchase Flow"
```

**Expected Results**: Summary metrics for successful purchase workflows

### Step 4.4: Compare Abandoned vs. Completed Carts

Compare sessions that added items but didn't purchase:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie action=addtocart OR action=purchase
| transaction JSESSIONID maxspan=30m
| eval purchaseCompleted = if(searchmatch("action=purchase"), "Yes", "No")
| stats count by purchaseCompleted
```

**Expected Results**: Count of sessions with completed vs. abandoned purchases

**Save this search as**: `L5S4`

> **Note**: startswith and endswith parameters:
> - Filter transactions to specific event patterns
> - Must match the raw event text or use field=value syntax
> - Useful for analyzing specific workflows
> - Help track conversion funnels and user journeys

## Task 5: Advanced Transaction Options

### Scenario

Fine-tune transaction creation with additional parameters for more accurate session analysis.

### Step 5.1: Use Maxspan Parameter

Limit transactions to a maximum time span:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID maxspan=30m
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| table JSESSIONID clientip durationMinutes eventcount
| sort -eventcount
```

**Expected Results**: Transactions limited to 30-minute windows, preventing unrealistic long sessions

### Step 5.2: Use Maxpause Parameter

Limit the pause between events within a transaction:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction clientip maxpause=5m maxspan=30m
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| where eventcount > 1
| table clientip durationMinutes eventcount action
| sort -durationMinutes
```

**Expected Results**: Transactions where events are no more than 5 minutes apart

### Step 5.3: Combine Multiple Parameters

Create precise transactions using multiple parameters:

```spl
index=web sourcetype=access_combined_wcookie
| transaction JSESSIONID maxspan=1h maxpause=10m startswith="action=view" endswith="action=purchase"
| eval durationMinutes = round(duration/60, 1)
| table JSESSIONID durationMinutes eventcount
| stats count as Purchases,
        avg(durationMinutes) as "Avg Duration",
        avg(eventcount) as "Avg Steps"
```

**Expected Results**: Refined purchase transactions with realistic time constraints

> **Tip**: Transaction command parameters:
> - **maxspan**: Maximum total time between first and last event
> - **maxpause**: Maximum time between individual events
> - **maxevents**: Maximum number of events in a transaction
> - **startswith/endswith**: Define transaction boundaries
> - Use these to prevent memory issues and create meaningful transactions
